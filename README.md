## Events & Me

The Events Page for all sorts of events big and small in the UK.

### Why this got started

While living in the UK I was always going to different events in different towns every weekend. My co-wokers were always on me about how I found all this events and that I should give them some info on the events when I find them. So I decided to create a page were I could aggregate all this events big or small from all around the UK. Started in Yorkshire area were I was living at the time and expanded from there.

### How do we get our events

This is the tricky part, I manually crawl around the internet looking for events that I believe would be interesting and different and an experience to see in the UK. Once I find one I scrape all the info that I can find sometimes going 2,3 pages deep to get all the details, and then puting it in. This is a lot of work so I got a couple people that I have given access to the page that can add events.

### What kind of events are found on the page

Any kind of event can be found on the page. We have 4 categories that are family, food, drink and music. This can be merged and other can be added in the future. But we look for the most interesting events that are mostly free or a small fee so families or groups can attend. Also a lot of the events are in towns that can have a train station for easy access.
